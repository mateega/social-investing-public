# Social Crypto Investing App

Despite a relatively massive shift towards collaborative and social trading, there is no easy way for retail investors to actually trade together while growing a community. Further, investing in cryptocurrencies is relatively difficult, with many investors wanting exposure to altcoins but not knowing enough about the crypto market to actually make trades themself.

This app aims to make cryptocurrency investing easier by allowing investors to trade together. Within the app, users can join groups and deposit paper money into the group’s pool of capital. Within each group, there are designated “investors” and “members.” Investors can trade the group’s pool of capital on behalf of the members. Each group is also equipt with a chat to encourage collaboration and communication before and after trades are executed.
